--> Currency Exchange App ğŸ’± <--

This is created for exchanging the Currencies of different Countries.

This project uses Node.js with Express for the server, Axios to make HTTP requests, and EJS as the templating language.

I have used a free api from [Exchange Rate API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/) to request currency codes and exchange rates.

Steps to start the Server:

1. you will need to get a free api key from the provider and put it in the variable in the server.js file.
2. you can then use npm i to install the node modules.
3. then use nodemon to start the server.
